# Loom: Static Site Web Development / Design UI

### To Run Locally
* Ensure you have Node.js >=8 with `npm` installed
* If Yarn is not installed, run `npm i -g yarn`
* From the root project directory, run:
  * `yarn install` (this only needs to be done once)
  * `yarn run ui`

The `examples` directory contains sample projects. These can be opened in Loom by selecting either the parent folder (such as `examples/simple`) or the `loom.json` file within.
