# Loom: One Web Development Tool for Everyone

## Releases
Release builds for Mac, Windows, and Linux can be found [here](https://github.com/kyle1320/loom/releases).

## Development
To start a development build locally:
* Ensure you have Node.js >=8 with `npm` installed
* If Yarn is not installed, run `npm i -g yarn`
* From the root project directory, run:
  * `yarn install` (this usually only needs to be done once)
  * `yarn run ui`

## Notes
The `examples` directory contains sample projects. These can be opened in Loom by selecting either the parent folder (such as `examples/simple`) or the `loom.json` file within.
